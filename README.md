# Squad of the Week

## Setup

Create a free api key with collegefootballdata.com

> [!WARNING]
> PLEASE DO NOT ABUSE! This is a very nice free api. Next.js caches responses so we don't send multiple requests.

Add to your `.env.local`:

```bash
CFB_DATA_TOKEN=<your-api-key>
```

## Install and Run

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
